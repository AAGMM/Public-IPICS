# Medical Imaging Server for DICOM

 [![Build Status](https://microsofthealthoss.visualstudio.com/DicomServer/_apis/build/status/CI-Build-OSS?branchName=master)](https://microsofthealthoss.visualstudio.com/DicomServer/_build/latest?definitionId=34&branchName=master)

The Medical Imaging Server for DICOM is an open source DICOM server that is easily deployed on Azure. It allows standards-based communication with any DICOMweb&trade; enabled systems, and injects DICOM metadata into a FHIR server to create a holistic view of patient data. The Medical Imaging Server for DICOM integrates tightly with the [Azure API for FHIR](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/healthcare-apis/) enabling healthcare professionals, ISVs, and medical device vendors to create new and innovative solutions. FHIR is becoming an important standard for clinical data and provides extensibility to support integration of other types of data directly, or through references. By using the Medical Imaging Server for DICOM, organizations can store references to imaging data in FHIR and enable queries across clinical and imaging datasets.

The Medical Imaging Server for DICOM is a .NET Core implementation of DICOMweb&trade;. [DICOMweb&trade;](https://www.dicomstandard.org/dicomweb) is the DICOM Standard for web-based medical imaging. Details of our conformance to the standard can be found in our [Conformance Statement](docs/resources/conformance-statement.md).

## Deploy the Medical Imaging Server for DICOM

The Medical Imaging Server for DICOM is designed to run on Azure for production workloads. However, for dev/test environments it can be deployed locally as a set of Docker containers to speed up development.

### Deploy to Azure

To deploy the Medical Imaging Server for DICOM to Azure, follow the instructions [here](docs/quickstarts/deploy-via-azure.md).
