Expired Medicines, How To Avoid Their Financial Losses

The objective of this IS how to  can solve the problem of Expired medicines
how to avoid their financial losses 
I believe that I have a better solution to face expired drug in USA pharmacy market and hospital.
The problem:

Pharmacies and hospitals, the pile of expired drugs they are required to toss out add up to about
$200,000 per hospital each year.
When you count the costs of expired medications that thrown away by pharmacies and consumers, at least $1 billion worth of drugs destroyed each year.
There’s a lot of waste in any hospital system,” noted Dr. Robert Pedowitz, DO, medical director of the Family Practice of CentraState in New Jersey. “From multi-use bottles used once and packages that are never opened, there’s so much we waste on a daily basis based on the expiration date and not because we know that it’s definitely not still good.”
