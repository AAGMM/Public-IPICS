# DICOM Conformance Statement

The **Azure for Health API** supports a subset of the DICOM Web standard. Support includes:

- [Store Transaction](##Store-Transaction)
- [Retrieve Transaction](##Retrieve-Transaction)
- [Delete Transaction](##Delete-Transaction)

## Store Transaction

This transaction uses the POST method to Store representations of Studies, Series, and Instances contained in the request payload.

| Method | Path               | Description |
| ------ | ------------------ | ----------- |
| POST   | ../studies         | Store instances. |
| POST   | ../studies/{study} | Store instances for a specific study. If an instance does not belong to the provided study identifier, that specific instance will be rejected with a '`43265`' warning code. |

Parameter `'study'` corresponds to the DICOM attribute StudyInstanceUID.

The following `'Accept'` headers for the response are supported:
- `application/dicom+json`

The following `'Content-Type'` headers are supported:
- `multipart/related; type=application/dicom`

> Note: The Server will <u>not</u> coerce or replace attributes that conflict with existing data. All data will be stored as provided.

The following DICOM elements are required to be present in every DICOM file attempting to be stored:
- StudyInstanceUID
- SeriesInstanceUID
- SopInstanceUID

> Note: All identifiers must be between 1 and 64 characters long, and only contain alpha numeric characters or the following special characters: '.', '-'.

Each file stored must have a unique combination of StudyInstanceUID, SeriesInstanceUID and SopInstanceUID. The warning code `45070` will be returned in the result if a file with the same identifiers exists.

### Response Status Codes

| Code                         | Description |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| 200 (OK)                     | When all the SOP instances in the request have been stored. |
| 202 (Accepted)               | When some instances in the request have been stored but others have failed. |
| 204 (No Content)             | No content was provided in the store transaction request. |
| 400 (Bad Request)            | The request was badly formatted. For example, the provided study instance identifier did not conform the expected UID format. |
| 406 (Not Acceptable)         | The specified `Accept` header is not supported. |
| 409 (Conflict)               | When none of the instances in the store transaction request have been stored. |
| 415 (Unsupported Media Type) | The provided `Content-Type` is not supported. |

### Response Payload

The response payload will populate a DICOM dataset with the following elements:

| Tag          | Name                  | Description |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ----------- |
| (0008, 1190) | RetrieveURL           | The Retrieve URL of the study if the StudyInstanceUID was provided in the store request. |
| (0008, 1198) | FailedSOPSequence     | The sequence of instances that failed to store. |
| (0008, 1199) | ReferencedSOPSequence | The sequence of stored instances. |

Each dataset in the `FailedSOPSequence` will have the following elements (if the DICOM file attempting to be stored could be read):

| Tag          | Name                     | Description |
| ------------ |------------------------- | ----------- |
| (0008, 1150) | ReferencedSOPClassUID    | The SOP class unique identifier of the instance that failed to store. |
| (0008, 1150) | ReferencedSOPInstanceUID | The SOP instance unique identifier of the instance that failed to store. |
| (0008, 1197) | FailureReason            | The reason code why this instance failed to store. |

Each dataset in the `ReferencedSOPSequence` will have the following elements:

| Tag          | Name                     | Description |
-------------- | ------------------------ | ----------- |
| (0008, 1150) | ReferencedSOPClassUID    | The SOP class unique identifier of the instance that failed to store. |
| (0008, 1150) | ReferencedSOPInstanceUID | The SOP instance unique identifier of the instance that failed to store. |
| (0008, 1190) | RetrieveURL              | The retrieve URL of this instance on the DICOM server. |

      }
    }]
  }
}
```

### Failure Reason Codes

| Code  | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| 272   | The store transaction did not store the instance because of a general failure in processing the operation. |
| 43264 | The DICOM instance failed the validation. |
| 43265 | The provided instance StudyInstanceUID did not match the specified StudyInstanceUID in the store request. |
| 45070 | A DICOM instance with the same StudyInstanceUID, SeriesInstanceUID and SopInstanceUID has already been stored. If you wish to update the contents, delete this instance first. |

## Retrieve Transaction

This Retrieve Transaction offers support for retrieving stored studies, series, instances and frames by reference.

The **Azure for Health** API supports the following methods:

| Method | Path                                                                  | Description |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| GET    | ../study/{study}                                                      | Retrieves an entire study. |
| GET    | ../study/{study}/metadata                                             | Retrieves all the metadata for every instance in the study. |
| GET    | ../study/{study}/series/{series}                                      | Retrieves an series. |
| GET    | ../study/{study}/series/{series}/metadata                             | Retrieves all the metadata for every instance in the series. |
| GET    | ../study/{study}/series/{series}/instances/{instance}                 | Retrieves a single instance. |
| GET    | ../study/{study}/series/{series}/instances/{instance}/metadata        | Retrieves the metadata for a single instance. |
| GET    | ../study/{study}/series/{series}/instances/{instance}/frames/{frames} | Retrieves one or many frames from a single instance. To specify more than one frame, a comma seperate each frame to return, e.g. /study/1/series/2/instance/3/frames/4,5,6 |

### Retrieve Study or Series
The following `'Accept'` headers are supported for retrieving study or series:
- `multipart/related; type="application/dicom"; transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.1 (default)`
- `multipart/related; type="application/dicom"; transfer-syntax=*`

### Retrieve Metadata (for Study/ Series/ or Instance)
The following `'Accept'` headers are supported for retrieving metadata for a study, series or single instance:
- `application/dicom+json (default)`

Retrieving metadata will not return attributes with the following value representations:
VR Name|Full
----------|----------
OB|Other Byte
OD|Other Double
OF|Other Float
OL|Other Long
OV|Other Long
OV|Other 64-Bit Very Long
OW|Other Word
UN|Unkown

### Retrieve Frames
The following `'Accept'` headers are supported for retrieving frames:
- `multipart/related; type="application/octet-stream"; transfer-syntax=1.2.840.10008.1.2.1 (default)`
- `multipart/related; type="application/octet-stream"; transfer-syntax=*`

> If the `'transfer-syntax'` header is not set, the Retrieve Transaction will default to 1.2.840.10008.1.2.1 (Little Endian Explicit). <br/> It is worth noting that if a file was uploaded using a compressed transfer syntax, by default, the result will be re-encoded. This could reduce the performance of the DICOM server on 'retrieve'. In this case, it is recommended to set the `transfer-syntax` header to **'`*`'**, or store all files as Little Endian explicit.

### Response Status Codes

| Code              | Description |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| 200 (OK)          | All requested data has been retrieved. |
| 400 (Bad Request) | The request was badly formatted. For example, the provided study instance identifier did not conform the expected UID format or the requested transfer-syntax encoding is not supported. |
| 404 (Not Found)   | The specified DICOM resource could not be found. |

## Delete Transaction

This transaction is not part of the official DICOMweb standard. It uses the DELETE method to remove representations of Studies, Series, and Instances from the store.


| Method | Path                                                    | Description |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |------------ |
| DELETE | ../studies/{study}                                      | Delete all instances for a specific study. |
| DELETE | ../studies/{study}/series/{series}                      | Delete all instances for a specific series within a study. |
| DELETE | ../studies/{study}/series/{series}/instances/{instance} | Delete a specific instance within a series. |

Parameters `'study'`, `'series'` and `'instance'` correspond to the DICOM attributes StudyInstanceUID, SeriesInstanceUID and SopInstanceUID respectively.

There are no restrictions on the request's `'Accept'` header, `'Content-Type'` header or body content.

> Note: After a Delete transaction the deleted instances will not be recoverable.

### Response Status Codes

| Code              | |Description |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| 200 (OK)          | When all the SOP instances have been deleted. |
| 400 (Bad Request) | The request was badly formatted. |
| 404 (Not Found)   | When the specified series was not found within a study, or the specified instance was not found within the series. |

### Response Payload

The response body will be empty. The status code is the only useful information returned.
