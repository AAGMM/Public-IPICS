## Configure deployment settings

Configure the remaining deployment settings for your Medical Imaging Server. The default settings are appropriate for an excellent dev/test or proof-of-concept environment as they are inexpensive, yet perform well for small to medium loads. For a production environment, upgrading to regionally redundant storage, failover databases and autoscaling application servers is recommended.
