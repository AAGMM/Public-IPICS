# Export DICOM Files

The Medical Imaging Server for DICOM supports the bulk export of data to an [Azure Blob Storage account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/). Before starting, be sure that the feature is enabled in your [appsettings.json](../../src/Microsoft.Health.Dicom.Web/appsettings.json) or environment by setting the value `DicomServer:Features:EnableExtendedExport` to `true`.

The export API is available at `POST /export`. Given a *source*, the set of data to be exported, and a *destination*, the location to which data will be exported, the endpoint returns a reference to the newly-started long-running export operation. The duration of this operation depends on the volume of data to be exported.

## Example

The below example requests the export of the following DICOM resources to the blob container named `"export"` in the local Azure storage emulator:
- All instances within the study whose Study Instance UID is `1.2.3`
- All instances within the series whose Study Instance UID is `12.3` and Series Instance UID is `4.5.678`
- The instance whose Study Instance UID is `123.456`, Series Instance UID is `7.8`, and SOP Instance UID is `9.1011.12`

```http
POST /export HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "sources": {
        "type": "identifiers",
        "settings": {
            "values": [
                "1.2.3",
                "12.3/4.5.678",
                "123.456/7.8/9.1011.12"
            ]
        }
    },
    "destination": {
        "type": "azureblob",
        "settings": {
            "blobContainerName": "export",
            "connectionString": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true"
        }
    }
}
```

## Request

The request body consists of the export source and destination.

```json
{
    "source": {
        "type": "identifiers",
        "settings": {
            "setting1": "<value>",
            "setting2": "<value>"
        }
    },
    "destination": {
        "type": "azureblob",
        "settings": {
            "setting3": "<value>"
        }
    }
}
```

### Source Settings

The only setting is the list of identifiers to export.

| Property | Required | Default | Description |
| :------- | :------- | :------ | :---------- |
| `Values` | Yes      |         | A list of one or more DICOM studies, series, and/or SOP instances identifiers in the format of `"<study instance UID>[/<series instance UID>[/<SOP instance UID>]]"` |

### Destination Settings

The connection to the Azure Blob storage account can be specified with either a `ConnectionString` and `BlobContainerName` or a `BlobContainerUri`. One of these settings is required.

If the storage account requires authentication, a [SAS token](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview) can be included in either the `ConnectionString` or `BlobContaienrUri` with `Write` permissions for `Objects` in the `Blob` service. A managed identity can also be used to access the storage account with the `UseManagedIdentity` option. The identity must be used by both the DICOM server and the functions, and furthermore it must be assigned the [`Storage Blob Data Contributor`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-contributor) role.

| Property             | Required | Default | Description |
| :------------------- | :------- | :------ | :---------- |
| `BlobContainerName`  | No       | `""`    | The name of a blob container. Only required when `ConnectionString` is specified |
| `BlobContainerUri`   | No       | `""`    | The complete URI for the blob container                      |
| `ConnectionString`   | No       | `""`    | The [Azure Storage connection string](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-configure-connection-string) that must minimally include information for blob storage |
| `UseManagedIdentity` | No       | `false` | An optional flag indicating whether managed identity should be used to authenticate to the blob container |

## Response

Upon successfully starting an export operation, the export API returns a `202` status code. The body of the response contains a reference to the operation, while the value of the `Location` header is the URL for the export operation's status (the same as `href` in the body).

Inside of the destination container, the DCM files can be found with the following path format: `<operation id>/results/<study>/<series>/<sop instance>.dcm`

```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "id": "df1ff476b83a4a3eaf11b1eac2e5ac56",
    "href": "<base url>/<version>/operations/df1ff476b83a4a3eaf11b1eac2e5ac56"
}
```

### Operation Status
The above `href` URL can be polled for the current status of the export operation until completion. A terminal state is signified by a `200` status instead of `202`.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "operationId": "df1ff476b83a4a3eaf11b1eac2e5ac56",
    "type": "export",
    "createdTime": "2022-09-08T16:40:36.2627618Z",
    "lastUpdatedTime": "2022-09-08T16:41:01.2776644Z",
    "status": "completed",
    "results": {
        "errorHref": "<container uri>/4853cda8c05c44e497d2bc071f8e92c4/errors.log",
        "exported": 1000,
        "skipped": 3
    }
}
```

## Errors

If there are any errors when exporting a DICOM file (that was determined not to be a problem with the client), then the file is skipped and its corresponding error is logged. This error log is also exported alongside the DICOM files and can be reviewed by the caller. The error log can be found at `<export blob container uri>/<operation ID>/errors.log`.

### Format

Each line of the error log is a JSON object with the following properties. Note that a given error identifier may appear multiple times in the log as each update to the log is processed *at least once*.

| Property     | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| `Timestamp`  | The date and time when the error occurred |
| `Identifier` | The identifier for the DICOM study, series, or SOP instance in the format of `"<study instance UID>[/<series instance UID>[/<SOP instance UID>]]"` |
| `Error`      | The error message |
